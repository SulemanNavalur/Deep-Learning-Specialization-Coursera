# Week 3

Course 5 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Sequence Models.

Week 3
 
In Week 3, we will Augment your sequence models using an attention mechanism, an algorithm that helps your model decide where to f
ocus its attention given a sequence of inputs. Then, explore speech recognition and how to deal with audio data.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe a basic sequence-to-sequence model.
* Compare and contrast several different algorithms for language translation.
* Optimize beam search and analyze it for errors.
* Use beam search to identify likely translations.
* Apply BLEU score to machine-translated text.
* Implement an attention model.
* Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions.
* Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets.
* Structure a speech recognition project.
