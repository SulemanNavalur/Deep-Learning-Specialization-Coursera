# Week 3

Course 2 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization.

Week 3
 
In Week 3, we will Explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks quickly and easily,
then train a neural network on a TensorFlow dataset.

## Learning Objectives

* Master the process of hyperparameter tuning.
* Describe softmax classification for multiple classes.
* Apply batch normalization to make your neural network more robust.
* Build a neural network in TensorFlow and train it on a TensorFlow dataset.
* Describe the purpose and operation of GradientTape.
* Use tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable.
* Apply TensorFlow decorators to speed up code.
* Explain the difference between a variable and a constant.
