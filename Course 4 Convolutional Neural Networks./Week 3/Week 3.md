# Week 3

Course 4 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Convolutional Neural Networks.

Week 3
 
In Week 3, we will Apply your new knowledge of CNNs to one of the hottest (and most challenging!) fields in computer vision: object detection.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify the components used for object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...) and their purpose.
* Implement object detection.
* Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy.
* Implement intersection over union.
* Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning.
* Apply sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction.
* Implement semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset.
* Explain the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net.
* Build a U-Net.
