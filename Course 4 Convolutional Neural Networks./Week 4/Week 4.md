# Week 4

Course 4 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Convolutional Neural Networks.

Week 4
 
In Week 4, we will Explore how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, 
then implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!

## Learning Objectives

* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification.
* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem.
* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition.
* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem.
* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model.
* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings.
* Implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm.
* Generate novel artistic images using Neural Style Transfer.
* Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer.
* Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer.
