# Week 2

Course 4 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Convolutional Neural Networks.

Week 2
 
In Week 2, we will Discover some powerful practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs, straight from the research papers, 
then apply transfer learning to your own deep CNN.

## Learning Objectives

* Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras.
* Train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
