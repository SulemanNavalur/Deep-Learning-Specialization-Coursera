# Week 1

Course 4 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Convolutional Neural Networks.

Week 1
 
In Week 1, we will Implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network 
to solve multi-class image classification problems..

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the convolution operation.
* Apply two different types of pooling operations.
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose.
* Build a convolutional neural network.
* Implement convolutional and pooling layers in numpy, including forward propagation.
* Implement helper functions to use when implementing a TensorFlow model.
* Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API.
* Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API.
* Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a binary classification problem.
* Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a multiclass classification problem.
* Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs.
