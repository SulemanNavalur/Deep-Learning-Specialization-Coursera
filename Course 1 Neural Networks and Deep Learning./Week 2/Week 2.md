# Week 2

Course 1 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

Week 2
 
In Week 2, we will learn to Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

## Learning Objectives

* Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network.
* Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization 
implemetation (gradient descent).
* Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models.
* Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
* Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations.
* Work with iPython Notebooks.
* Implement vectorization across multiple training examples.
* Explain the concept of broadcasting.
