# Week 3

Course 1 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

Week 3
 
In Week 3, we will Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe hidden units and hidden layers.
* Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh.
* Implement forward and backward propagation.
* Apply random initialization to your neural network.
* Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations.
* Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer.
* Compute the cross entropy loss.
