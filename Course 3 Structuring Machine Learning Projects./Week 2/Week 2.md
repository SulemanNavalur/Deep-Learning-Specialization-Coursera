# Week 2

Course 3 of Deep Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Structuring Machine Learning Projects.

Week 2
 
In Week 2, we will Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain 
intuition for how to split your data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning.
* Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets.

## Content

In Week 2 we get to see,
 
* Error Analysis.
* Mismatched Training and Dev/Test Set.
* Learning from Multiple Tasks.
* End-to-end Deep Learning.

## Practice Quiz

One Practice Quiz's,

* Autonomous Driving.
